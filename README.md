# Live-Photo-in-Watch-Proposal
Photo in watch proposal for a upwork customer done in swift.
Iphone side loads in a photo library and prompts user to select a photo.
As soon as photo is selected Watch Connectivity Framework handles the image transfer.  This version transfers raw image.  Final customer version compressed image for faster transfer time and energy savings on the apple watch side.
Apple watch shows an image when one is sent via Watch Connectivity.
There is also a version I did in objective c that does the same thing just to show customer I can code in both and a final project that connected to BLE device and transfered information to apple watch in 3 ways.  1 to transfer the identitiy of the image ble device is pointing at 2 is to transfer a compressed image and 3 is to transfer custom images for storage on watch so the fast pointer would work easily.
This project took me a little under a week to complete back in October 2017.  Iphone side was completed by a third party but apple watch extension was done by me along with a small tutorial on setup.  I am sharing it because customer decided to scrap the project after a while.
